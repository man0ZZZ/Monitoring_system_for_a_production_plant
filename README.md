# Production Plant Data for Condition Monitoring

This GitHub repository focuses on a use case that revolves around predicting the condition of a critical component within production lines. The condition of this component is crucial for both the plant's functionality and the quality of the resulting products.

## Overview

- **Datasets:** This repository contains data from 8 run-to-failure experiments and real-time data from 8 sensors.
- **Feature Selection:** We employed feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant features that describe the condition of the machine.
- **Autoencoder Model:** We built and trained an autoencoder model to learn the new condition representations of the machines.
- **Anomaly Detection:** The trained model was used to detect anomalies in real-time test datasets.
